* @description
* The SDK Index is automatically built by the LoopBack SDK Builder.
*
* The SDK Index will temporally keep providing access to everything in the SDK
* including services. This is because will maintain backwards compatibility for those
* Applications below Angular 2 RC 5 version that does not support NgModule just yet.
*
* IMPORTANT NOTE:
*
* If your application is equal or above RC 5 It is recommended to import the SDK
* Module located in ./sdk.module.ts and follow the instructions.
*
* Also, It is recommended for you to start upgrading your application in order to 
* support NgModules before backwards support is also dropped by Angular.
*
* READ: https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/rc4-to-rc5.html#!#5-cleanup
